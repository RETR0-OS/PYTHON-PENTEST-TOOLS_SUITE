## Usage
The program is divided into two separate halves: the client side program and opendoor script (to be uploaded on target system), and  and listener and prydoor script (to be run on attacker system). The scripts allow persistence on Windows 10 OS. However, it may be modified to accomodate the same for other operating systems as well.
The standard commands are included in the help message with the program. All OS specific commands are supported as well. The script also supports file upload and download.

### Note: This program is not designed to cause any harm to the community. It is merely for educational purposes. The users are responsible for their own actions and shall have to face the consequences for the misuse of these scripts. the author is not liable for ABSOLUTELY ANY HARM CAUSED BY THIS PROGRAM. USER DISRECTION RECCOMENDED.

`Note: These scripts are written in python. thus the attacker needs to ensure that the target system has a python interpreter installed along with the required packages. The prerequisite packages are listed in the requirements.txt file. Alternatively, you may compile the packages locally into standalone executables and then use prefered delivery method to deliver the executables to the target systems. Ensure that you complie the Opendoor.py and reverse_backdoor_client_side.py into one executable as per your requirements, and the attacker side scripts into a seperate excutable. Please refer to the internet to learn how to compile python scripts to standalones.`

### Client Side Scripts
The client side scripts include two scripts:
  - Opendoor.py
  - reverse_backdoor_client_side.py
##### Opendoor.py
The opendoor.py script controls the execution of the program. It works off of the reverse_backdoor_client_side.py script. The two files must be uploaded in the same directory on the target system. The script establishes a reverse connection on the IP and port specifed in the corresponding variables defined in this script before upload. Please ensure that that the IP is static and on the same network as the target. For cross network attacks, please look into port forwarding and iptable rules for your specific system.

##### reverse_backdoor_client_side.py
The class-based script that is the brains of the entire program. This OOP script is desgined to be readable and easily extendable to add functionalities. I do not recommend tampering with the script unless you possess strong foundations of python OOP. The program uitlizes the socket module in order to establish a reverse connection from the rtarget machine to the host, thus making the connection less suspicious and extremely stable.


### Attacker Side Scripts 

##### Prydoor.py
This script is works off of the the reverse_backdoor_listener.py script. It handles user interaction with the program. You are to change the IP address and port variables to your attacker machine Ip address and the listening port you chose in the opendoor.py script. 

##### reverse_backdoor_listener.py
This class-based script handles all the attacker interations with the client side script. This OOP script is also designed to be easily extendable to additional functionalities. I do not recommend tampering with the script unless you possess strong foundations of python OOP. The program uitlizes the socket module in order to listen for incoming connections, thus making the connection less suspicious and extremely stable. Make sure your OS and firewall instructios allow listening and accepting connections on the port you specified in order of this to work.


### Features
  - File upload/Download
  - Directory transversal
  - Persistance (Windows 10)
  - I/O stability
  - Graceful exit
  - Multi-OS support

##Execution
Deliver the client side script to the target system via your prefered delivery method. Then, start the listener script on your local machine. Once the target executes the script on their system, you will recieve a reverse connection on your system from the target, giving you complete access to their command line.
