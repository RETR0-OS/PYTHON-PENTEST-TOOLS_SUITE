## Usage
The program is divided into two separate halves: the client side program and opendoor script (to be uploaded on target system), and  and listener and prydoor script (to be run on attacker system). The scripts allow persistence on Windows 10 OS. However, it may be modified to accomodate the same for other operating systems as well.
The standard commands are included in the help message with the program. All OS specific commands are supported as well. The script also supports file upload and download.

### Client Side Scripts
The client side scripts include two scripts:
  - Opendoor.py
  - reverse_backdoor_client_side.py
##### Opendoor.py
The opendoor.py script controls the execution of the program. It works off of the reverse_backdoor_client_side.py script. The two files must be uploaded in the same directory on the target system. The script establishes a reverse connection on the IP and port specifed in the corresponding variables defined in this script before upload. Please ensure that that the IP is static and on the same network as the target. For cross network attacks, please look into port forwarding and iptable rules for your specific system.
