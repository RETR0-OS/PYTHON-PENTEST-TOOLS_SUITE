## Usage
The program is divided into two separate halves: the client side program and opendoor script (to be uploaded on target system), and  and listener and prydoor script (to be run on attacker system). The scripts allow persistence on Windows 10 OS. However, it may be modified to accomodate the same for other operating systems as well.
The standard commands are included in the help message with the program. All OS specific commands are supported as well. The script also supports file upload and download.

`Note: These scripts are written in python. thus the attacker needs to ensure that the target system has a python interpreter installed along with the required packages. Alternatively, you may compile the packages locally into standalone executables and then use prefered delivery method to deliver the executables to the target systems. Ensure that you complie the Opendoor.py and reverse_backdoor_client_side.py into one executable as per your requirements, and the attacker side scripts into a seperate excutable. Please refer to the internet to learn how to compile python scripts to standalones.`

### Client Side Scripts
The client side scripts include two scripts:
  - Opendoor.py
  - reverse_backdoor_client_side.py
##### Opendoor.py
The opendoor.py script controls the execution of the program. It works off of the reverse_backdoor_client_side.py script. The two files must be uploaded in the same directory on the target system. The script establishes a reverse connection on the IP and port specifed in the corresponding variables defined in this script before upload. Please ensure that that the IP is static and on the same network as the target. For cross network attacks, please look into port forwarding and iptable rules for your specific system.

##### reverse_backdoor_client_side.py
The class-based script that is the brains of the entire program. This OOP script is desgined to be readable and easily extendable to add functionalities. We donot recommend tampering with the script unless you possess strong foundations of python OOP. The program uitlizes the socket module in order to establish a reverse connection from the rtarget machine to the host, thus making the connection less suspicious and extremely stable.
